## 🔷 What is TCP?

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is a **communication protocol** used to send data over the internet or any network.

> It ensures that **data is delivered correctly, in order, and without errors** between two devices (computers, phones, servers...).

## ✅ Key Features of TCP

| Feature                 | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 **Reliable**         | TCP ensures that all data sent is received, and retransmits it if needed. |
| 📦 **Ordered**          | Packets arrive **in the same order** they were sent.                      |
| 🧩 **Connection-based** | Requires a connection (called a **handshake**) before sending data.       |
| 🔐 **Error Checking**   | TCP checks for errors in data and corrects them.                          |
| 📥 **Flow Control**     | Avoids overwhelming the receiver by managing the data rate.               |

## 🔄 How TCP Works (Simplified)

### 🔸 1. **Three-Way Handshake**

To start communication:

1. **Client → Server**: Sends `SYN` (synchronize)
2. **Server → Client**: Sends `SYN-ACK`
3. **Client → Server**: Sends `ACK`

✅ Connection established.

### 🔸 2. **Data Transfer**

* Data is split into small parts called **segments**.
* Each segment is numbered.
* TCP makes sure they arrive **in order**.
* If a segment is **lost**, it is **retransmitted**.

---

### 🔸 3. **Connection Termination**

* After data is sent, both sides agree to **close the connection** using `FIN` and `ACK` flags.

---

## 🧪 Real-Life Example:

### Think of sending a long message via registered mail:

* You break it into envelopes (segments).
* Each envelope is numbered.
* The receiver confirms receiving each one.
* If one is missing, you resend it.
* You don’t stop until the receiver gets **everything correctly**.

That’s **TCP**.

## 🆚 TCP vs UDP

| Feature     | **TCP**                      | **UDP**                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Connection  | Yes (handshake)              | No (connectionless)          |
| Reliability | Reliable (resends lost data) | Unreliable (no guarantee)    |
| Speed       | Slower                       | Faster                       |
| Usage       | Web, email, file transfer    | Video streaming, games, VoIP |

## 🧠 Where is TCP used?

* 🌐 **Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)**
* 📩 **Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)**
* 📁 **File transfers (FTP)**
* 📦 **Data backup and sync**
