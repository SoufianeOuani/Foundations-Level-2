### **What is a Domain Name?**

* A **Domain Name** is the human-readable address of a website.
* It acts like the “nickname” of an IP address (the actual numeric address of a server).
* Instead of remembering numbers like `192.168.1.1`, we use names like `google.com`.

👉 Example:

* **Domain Name:** `openai.com`
* **IP Address (behind it):** `104.18.12.123`

When you type a domain name into your browser:

1. The **DNS (Domain Name System)** translates that domain into the correct IP address.
2. Your browser then connects to the server hosting the website.

So in short: **Domain Name = Website Address**.

### **From Where Do You Get a Domain Name?**

You cannot just invent and use a domain name freely (unless it’s only for local/private use).
To use it on the Internet, you must **register** it with a **Domain Registrar**.

#### 🔑 Steps to Get a Domain:

1. **Choose a Domain Name**

   * Something short, memorable, and relevant.
   * Example: `sofiane-tech.com`

2. **Check Availability**

   * Use a registrar’s search tool to see if it’s already taken.

3. **Register Through a Domain Registrar**

   * Common registrars:

     * **Namecheap**
     * **GoDaddy**
     * **Google Domains** (now part of Squarespace)
     * **Hostinger**
     * **Bluehost**

4. **Pay for the Domain**

   * Usually yearly fees (e.g., `$10 – $15 per year` for a `.com`).
   * Premium names can cost thousands if they’re very popular.

5. **Connect Domain to Hosting**

   * Once you have a domain, you point it to your web hosting/server using **DNS records**.

### **Types of Domains**

* **TLDs (Top-Level Domains):** `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.gov`, etc.
* **Country Codes:** `.ma` (Morocco), `.fr` (France), `.uk` (United Kingdom).
* **New TLDs:** `.app`, `.tech`, `.dev`, etc.

---

✅ **In summary:**

* A **Domain Name** is the address people type to visit your website.
* You get one from a **Domain Registrar**, usually paying yearly.
* Without it, you’d have to share your website as just an **IP address**, which is not user-friendly.
