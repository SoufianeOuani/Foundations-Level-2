## 🌍 **IP Address Types Overview**

IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) are categorized based on:

* **Scope** (Public or Private)
* **Function** (Unicast, Multicast, etc.)
* **How they're assigned** (Static or Dynamic)

---

## 🟦 PART 1: **IPv4 Address Types**

### 🔹 1. **Private IP Address**

* Used **within a local network** (home, office, etc.)
* **Not routable on the internet**
* Assigned by routers or manually

| IP Range                      | Class |
| ----------------------------- | ----- |
| 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255     | A     |
| 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255   | B     |
| 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | C     |

Example: `192.168.1.10`

---

### 🔹 2. **Public IP Address**

* **Globally unique**, used to connect to the **internet**
* Assigned by **ISPs (Internet Service Providers)**
* Example: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)

---

### 🔹 3. **Loopback IP Address**

* Refers to **the local machine**
* Always: `127.0.0.1`
* Used for testing software/network on your own device

---

### 🔹 4. **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)**

* Given automatically if DHCP server is not available
* Range: `169.254.0.0 – 169.254.255.255`
* Used in local networks temporarily

---

### 🔹 5. **Broadcast Address**

* Used to send a message to **all devices** on a network
* Example: `192.168.1.255` in a local network

---

### 🔹 6. **Multicast Address**

* Used to send data to **a group of devices**
* Range: `224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255`

---

## 🟩 PART 2: **IPv6 Address Types**

### 🔹 1. **Unicast Address**

* One-to-one communication
* Device gets a **unique IPv6 address**
* Example: `2001:db8::1`

---

### 🔹 2. **Multicast Address**

* One-to-many communication
* Sends data to **multiple devices at once**
* Range: Starts with `ff00::/8`

---

### 🔹 3. **Anycast Address**

* One-to-nearest communication
* Data sent to **the nearest device** in a group (based on routing)
* No special format (uses unicast-style addresses)

---

### 🔹 4. **Link-local Address**

* Used only **within the same network segment (LAN)**
* Always starts with: `fe80::/10`
* Auto-assigned (like APIPA in IPv4)

---

### 🔹 5. **Loopback Address**

* Same as in IPv4, refers to the local machine
* Always: `::1`

---

## 🟨 PART 3: **Based on Assignment**

### 🔸 1. **Static IP**

* Manually assigned to a device
* Doesn't change
* Used for servers, printers, routers, etc.

### 🔸 2. **Dynamic IP**

* Assigned automatically by **DHCP**
* May change over time
* Used for most home devices (phones, laptops, etc.)

| Private IP | `192.168.1.1`   | `fd00::1` (ULA)                 | Local networks              |
| Loopback   | `127.0.0.1`     | `::1`                           | Local testing               |
| Link-local | `169.254.x.x`   | `fe80::1`                       | Same-network communication  |
| Multicast  | `224.0.0.1`     | `ff02::1`                       | Group communication         |
| Broadcast  | `192.168.1.255` | *N/A* (not in IPv6)             | All devices in IPv4 network |
| Anycast    | *N/A*           | `2001:db8::1` (used as anycast) | Closest node routing        |
