## 💻 What is a **Server**?

A **server** is a **powerful computer or software** that provides services, data, or resources to other computers (called **clients**) over a network.

Think of it as a **provider**, while clients are **requesters**.

### 🧠 Example:

* You open a website → your device is the **client**, and the **web server** sends you the webpage.
