### **1. Definition**

A **Subnet Mask** is a number (like `255.255.255.0`) that tells your computer **which part of an IP address is the network** and **which part is the host**.

* **Network part** → Identifies the network you’re on (like a street name).
* **Host part** → Identifies a specific device on that network (like a house number).

---

### **2. Why it’s needed**

Without a subnet mask, your computer wouldn’t know:

* Which devices are in your **local network** (talk directly to them)
* Which devices are **outside your network** (send data through a router)

---

### **3. Example**

If your IP is:

```
192.168.1.10  
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

* The `255` parts mean **network** (fixed).
* The `0` part means **host** (can change).
* So:

  * **Network** = `192.168.1`
  * **Host** = `10` (your device)

This means any IP from `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254` is in your local network.

---

### **4. Quick analogy**

* **IP address** = Street + House number (e.g., “Main Street, House 12”)
* **Subnet mask** = A rule saying: “All houses on **Main Street** belong to this neighborhood.”
