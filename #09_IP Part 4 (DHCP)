## **What is DHCP?**

**DHCP** stands for **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**.
It’s a network service that **automatically assigns**:

1. **IP Address** (e.g., `192.168.1.15`)
2. **Subnet Mask** (e.g., `255.255.255.0`)
3. **Default Gateway** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
4. **DNS Server** (e.g., `8.8.8.8`)

Without DHCP, you’d have to manually type these for every device — and if two devices accidentally got the same IP, chaos would happen (called an **IP conflict**).

## **How DHCP Works (The DORA Process)**

When a new device connects to a network, this 4-step process happens:

1. **D – Discover**

   * The device sends a broadcast message: *“Hey, is there a DHCP server here?”*
2. **O – Offer**

   * The DHCP server replies: *“Yes, here’s an available IP for you.”*
3. **R – Request**

   * The device says: *“Great, I’d like that IP, please.”*
4. **A – Acknowledge**

   * The DHCP server confirms: *“You got it. Here’s your full network info.”*

## **DHCP Lease**

* The IP address is given for a **lease time** (e.g., 24 hours).
* When the lease expires, the device must renew it — usually without you noticing.

## **Where is DHCP Found?**

* **Home networks:** Usually your **router** (or gateway) acts as the DHCP server.
* **Large networks:** Dedicated DHCP servers handle the job for many devices.

## **Analogy**

Think of a **hotel**:

* **You** = the device
* **Reception desk** = the DHCP server
* **Room number** = IP address
* **Check-in process** = DORA steps
  When you check in (connect), reception gives you an available room (IP). When you leave (disconnect), the room is freed for others.
