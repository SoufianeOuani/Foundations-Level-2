### **1. Socket**

A **socket** is like a *doorway* inside a computer program that allows it to send and receive data over a network.

* Itâ€™s created in your code using the operating systemâ€™s networking API.
* It combines:

  * **IP address** â†’ *Where to send data*
  * **Port number** â†’ *Which service or program to send data to*
* Example:

  * Your browser creates a socket to connect to `142.250.190.78:443` (Googleâ€™s IP, port 443 for HTTPS).

### **2. Port**

A **port** is like a numbered *mailbox* on a computer for network messages.

* Each service (web server, email server, game server) listens on a specific port number.
* Common examples:

  * Port **80** â†’ HTTP (web traffic)
  * Port **443** â†’ HTTPS (secure web traffic)
  * Port **25** â†’ SMTP (email sending)
* Ports range from **0 to 65535**.

  * **0â€“1023** â†’ Well-known ports (standard services)
  * **1024â€“49151** â†’ Registered ports
  * **49152â€“65535** â†’ Dynamic/private ports

ðŸ’¡ **Quick analogy**

* **IP address** = Street address of a building.
* **Port** = Apartment number inside that building.
* **Socket** = The open door connecting your room (program) to another personâ€™s room on the network.
