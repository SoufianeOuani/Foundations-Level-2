## **HTTP vs HTTPS Protocols**

### **1. Definition**

* **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):**
  A protocol used to **transfer data** between your browser and a web server. It allows you to **view web pages** and send/receive information.

* **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):**
  The **secure version of HTTP**. It encrypts the data being sent and received, protecting it from hackers or eavesdroppers.

### **2. Key Differences**

| Feature             | HTTP                        | HTTPS                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Security**        | Not secure                  | Secure (data encrypted)        |
| **Port Number**     | 80                          | 443                            |
| **Data Protection** | Can be intercepted          | Encrypted with SSL/TLS         |
| **Use**             | Basic websites, public info | Banking, shopping, login pages |
| **URL Prefix**      | http\://                    | https\://                      |

### **3. How HTTPS Works**

1. Your browser connects to the website.
2. The server provides an **SSL/TLS certificate**.
3. Browser and server **establish an encrypted connection**.
4. All data sent between you and the server is **encrypted**, preventing hackers from stealing it.

### **4. Analogy**

* **HTTP:** Like sending a **postcard** â€” anyone handling it can read your message.
* **HTTPS:** Like sending a **sealed, locked envelope** â€” only the recipient can read the message.

ðŸ’¡ **Key takeaway:**
Always prefer **HTTPS websites**, especially when sharing **sensitive information** like passwords, credit cards, or personal data.
