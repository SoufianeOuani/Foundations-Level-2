### **What is a Subdomain?**

* A **Subdomain** is an additional part of your main domain name.
* It appears **before the main domain name**.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

* Main domain: `example.com`
* Subdomains:

  * `blog.example.com`
  * `shop.example.com`
  * `mail.example.com`

So, a **subdomain is like a child of the main domain**.

### **Why Use Subdomains?**

1. **Organize different sections of a website**

   * `store.mysite.com` â†’ for e-commerce
   * `support.mysite.com` â†’ for help center

2. **Separate services**

   * `mail.google.com` â†’ Gmail
   * `drive.google.com` â†’ Google Drive
   * `maps.google.com` â†’ Google Maps

3. **Testing / Development**

   * `dev.mysite.com` â†’ development version
   * `test.mysite.com` â†’ testing environment

4. **Multilingual sites**

   * `en.wikipedia.org` â†’ English version
   * `fr.wikipedia.org` â†’ French version

### **How Are Subdomains Created?**

* Subdomains are managed through **DNS settings**.
* On your domainâ€™s DNS zone, you can create an **A record** or **CNAME record** for the subdomain and point it to a server.

ðŸ‘‰ Example DNS setup:

* `A record` for `blog.example.com` â†’ points to server IP `192.168.1.1`.
* `CNAME record` for `shop.example.com` â†’ points to `example.com`.

### **Difference Between Subdomain and Subdirectory**

* **Subdomain:** `blog.example.com`
* **Subdirectory:** `example.com/blog`

Both are ways to organize content, but:

* **Subdomains** are treated like separate entities in DNS.
* **Subdirectories** are just folders inside your main website.

---

âœ… **In summary:**

* A **subdomain** is a prefix added to your main domain.
* Useful for separating services, organizing content, testing, and multilingual versions.
* Configured via DNS records.
