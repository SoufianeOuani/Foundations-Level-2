## 🌐 What is IP?

**IP (Internet Protocol)** is a set of rules that governs **how data is sent and received across networks**.

* Every device connected to a network (like the internet) has an **IP address**, just like every house has a mailing address.
* The IP address identifies **where the device is** so data can be routed correctly.

## 🔢 What is IPv4?

### IPv4 = **Internet Protocol version 4**

It is the **most commonly used version** of IP.

### ✅ Example of an IPv4 address:

```
192.168.1.1
```

---

## 🔍 Structure of IPv4

* IPv4 uses **32 bits**.
* Written as **four decimal numbers** (each from 0 to 255), separated by dots.
* Each part is called an **octet** (8 bits).

### Example:

```
11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001 → 192.168.1.1
```

## 🎯 What is an IPv4 address used for?

* To **identify a device** on a network.
* To **route data** between source and destination.
* Every website, phone, laptop, server has an IP.

## 📂 Types of IPv4 Addresses

| Type              | Example         | Use Case                         |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Public IP         | 8.8.8.8         | Used on the internet             |
| Private IP        | 192.168.1.10    | Used in home/office networks     |
| Loopback          | 127.0.0.1       | Refers to the local machine      |
| Broadcast         | 255.255.255.255 | Send to all devices on a network |
| APIPA (Automatic) | 169.254.x.x     | Assigned when DHCP fails         |

## 🧠 How many IPv4 addresses exist?

* Total: **2³² = 4,294,967,296** addresses
* Many are reserved (private, multicast, etc.)
* That's why we are moving to **IPv6** (which supports 340 undecillion addresses!)

---

## 🔧 Example Use in Real Life:

* You type `google.com` in your browser.
* DNS translates it to an IPv4 address like `142.250.190.78`.
* Your computer connects to that IP using **TCP/IP**.
