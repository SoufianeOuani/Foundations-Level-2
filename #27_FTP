### **What is FTP?**

* **FTP** stands for **File Transfer Protocol**.
* It is a **standard protocol** used to transfer files between a **client** (your computer) and a **server** over a network (like the Internet).

👉 In simple words:
FTP is like a “digital courier” that **uploads** files from your computer to a server or **downloads** files from a server to your computer.

### **How Does FTP Work?**

* FTP follows the **client–server model**:

  1. You (the client) connect to an FTP server.
  2. You authenticate with a **username and password** (some servers allow anonymous login).
  3. Once connected, you can:

     * **Upload files** → from your local machine to the server.
     * **Download files** → from the server to your machine.
     * **Delete, rename, or move files** on the server.

### **FTP Structure**

* **Port Numbers:**

  * Default port for FTP = **21**.
  * Some modes also use port **20** for data transfer.

* **Two Modes of FTP:**

  1. **Active Mode** – Server initiates the data connection.
  2. **Passive Mode** – Client initiates both control and data connections (commonly used today, especially behind firewalls).

### **FTP Commands (Basic Examples)**

If you use a command-line FTP client:

* `ftp server.com` → connect to server
* `user` → enter username
* `pass` → enter password
* `ls` → list files
* `get file.txt` → download a file
* `put file.txt` → upload a file
* `bye` → exit

### **Limitations of FTP**

* **Not secure**:

  * Data (including username & password) is sent in **plain text**.
  * Hackers can intercept easily.

* **Solution:** Use secure versions:

  * **FTPS** (FTP Secure) → FTP + SSL/TLS encryption.
  * **SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol) → works over SSH, more secure.

### **Real-World Uses of FTP**

* Web developers use FTP to upload website files to a hosting server.
* Companies use FTP to exchange large files between branches.
* IT admins use it for server management and backups.

✅ **In summary:**

* **FTP = File Transfer Protocol.**
* Used for transferring files between client and server.
* Runs on port **21**.
* Not secure by default → use **FTPS or SFTP** for security.
