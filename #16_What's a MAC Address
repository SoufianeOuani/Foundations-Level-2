## **MAC Address – Media Access Control Address**

### **1. Definition**

A **MAC Address** (Media Access Control Address) is a **unique identifier** assigned to every network interface card (NIC) by its manufacturer.

* It’s **hard-coded into the hardware** (in the card’s firmware).
* It is used to **identify devices within a local network (LAN)**.
* Example format:

  ```
  00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
  ```

---

### **2. Format and Structure**

* **Length:** 48 bits (6 bytes) long.
* **Written in:** Hexadecimal notation (numbers 0–9 and letters A–F).
* **Groups:** Six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (:) or hyphens (-).

**Example breakdown:**
`00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

* **First 3 bytes** (00:1A:2B) → **OUI** (Organizationally Unique Identifier): identifies the manufacturer.
* **Last 3 bytes** (3C:4D:5E) → Device-specific unique number.

---

### **3. Function**

* Operates in the **Data Link Layer** (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
* Used **only within the local network segment**.
* Ensures that data packets reach the correct physical device in a LAN.

### **4. MAC vs. IP Address**

| Feature     | MAC Address                             | IP Address                                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Assigned by | Manufacturer                            | Network administrator or automatically via DHCP |
| Changes?    | Normally fixed, unless manually changed | Can change depending on the network location    |
| Purpose     | Identifies the physical device          | Identifies the device’s location in the network |
| Layer (OSI) | Data Link Layer (Layer 2)               | Network Layer (Layer 3)                         |
| Analogy     | Car license plate                       | Street address                                  |

### **5. Real-life Analogy**

Think of the MAC Address like a **car’s license plate**:

* It is unique to the car (device).
* It’s assigned when the car is manufactured.
* Even if the car moves to a different city (network), the license plate stays the same.

The IP Address is like the **street address** where the car is parked — it can change depending on where the car is located.

### **6. Example in Networking**

When a computer wants to send data to another computer on the same local network:

1. It uses the **IP address** to identify the target logically.
2. It uses the **MAC address** to find the exact physical device.
3. The **ARP protocol** (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to translate IP → MAC.

✅ **Key points for students to remember:**

* MAC = Permanent physical identity (Layer 2).
* IP = Logical location (Layer 3).
* Both are essential for communication: MAC for delivery inside the LAN, IP for routing across networks.
